In this file, we will walkthrough the part of the game that we will be
implementing in the upcoming homeworks. By reading this file, you will
understand why we want to create the directory structure we need to
make in this homework. At the end of this file, the full structure is
summarized.

The walkthrough:

To run the game, execute emacs like this:
-- % cd PA1assignment
-- % ls savedgame
-- savedgame
-- % emacs -batch -l dunnet
-- 
-- Dead end
-- You are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.
-- In the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The
-- trees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant
-- from each other.
-- There is a shovel here.
-- >

Now that the game is running, we'll load up the part that we'll be using
for this homework:
-- >restore savedgame
-- Done.
-- Museum station
-- You are at the Museum subway stop.  A passage leads off to the north.
-- >

We are now in the first room of the part of the game that we will be working
with. We'll call this room A. The game says that you can only go north. But
let's try going south first:
-- >s
-- You can't go that way.
-- >n
-- N/S tunnel
-- You are in a north/south tunnel.
-- >

Yes, it is true that you could only go north. We are now in room B. But
what does it mean, in homework 1, to say that heading north from room A
takes you to room B? It means that you will create a subdirectory for
room B inside of room A. Now let's keep going:
-- >n
-- North end of N/S tunnel
-- You are at the north end of a north/south tunnel.  Stairs lead up and
-- down from here.  There is a garbage disposal here.
-- >x disposal
-- I see nothing special about that.
-- >x garbage
-- I see nothing special about that.
-- >x stairs
-- I don't know what that is.
-- >

We'll call this new room, as room C. We see that there is a garbage disposal
here. This object can be examined by either the name disposal or the name
garbage. What this means, for homework 1, is that the directory for room C
will contain two files, named "garbage" and "disposal". Both of these files
will contain the same data, the sentence "I see nothing special about that."
(In homework 2, we will use the contents of these files to allow us to
implement an "x" command to display these object description sentences.) We
also see that the game has limits, because there are stairs here, but the
game doesn't understand the word "stairs". This means that we don't make a
file for this object.

Well, let's move on. Let's look again at the description of this room:
-- >look
-- North end of N/S tunnel
-- You are at the north end of a north/south tunnel.  Stairs lead up and
-- down from here.  There is a garbage disposal here.
-- >

We see that, from here we can go either up or down. What this means is that
room C will contain two subdirectories (one named "d" and one named "u"), in
addition to the "garbage" and "disposal" files. Let's go down first:
-- >d
-- Bottom of subway stairs
-- You are at the bottom of some stairs near the subway station.  There is
-- a room to the northeast.
-- There is a valuable amethyst here.
-- >x amethyst
-- I see nothing special about that.
-- >ne
-- Endgame computer room
-- You are in another computer room.  There is a computer in here larger
-- than you have ever seen.  It has no manufacturers name on it, but it
-- does have a sign that says: This machine's name is ‘endgame’.  The
-- exit is to the southwest.  There is no console here on which you could
-- type.
-- >x computer
-- I see nothing special about that.
-- >

Now we have visited rooms D & E. They both have objects in them. As for the
"computer" object, we will find that it has other allowed names:
-- >x pc
-- I see nothing special about that.
-- >x cabinet
-- I see nothing special about that.
-- >x vax
-- I see nothing special about that.
-- >

(A "vax" was an old brand of mainframe computer). Let's continue on.
The only exit from the computer room is to go back southwest. So:
-- >sw
-- Bottom of subway stairs
-- There is a valuable amethyst here.
-- >

From the above, we notice that the description is shorter for rooms we have
already visited. This will become relevant for the second homework. We also
can consider what it means (in our homework 1 directory structure) to go
back from room E to room D; it means to do a "cd ..". In other words, to get
to retrace our steps from room A to B to C to D to E and back to D, we would
go: "cd PA1/rooms; cd n; cd n; cd d; cd ne; cd ..".

Let's walk around some more:
-- >ne
-- Endgame computer room
-- >sw
-- Bottom of subway stairs
-- There is a valuable amethyst here.
-- >u
-- North end of N/S tunnel
-- >u
-- Top of subway stairs
-- You are at the top of some stairs near the subway station.  There is
-- a door to the west.
-- >

From the above, we see that some objects redisplay every time you enter the
room (such as the amethyst), but other objects only get mentioned the first
time you enter (such as the garbage disposal). We also see that we have gone
into a new room, room F. This room has an exit to the west we can follow:
-- >w
-- Classroom
-- You are in a classroom where school children were taught about natural
-- history.  On the blackboard is written, ‘No children allowed downstairs.’
-- There is a door to the east with an ‘exit’ sign on it.  There is another
-- door to the west.
-- There is a packet of glycerine here.
-- >e
-- The door is locked.
-- >

In the above, we see that we have encountered the locked door. We entered
from the unlocked side, but we cannot go back where we came. The way that
we will handle this is to create a file named "e" in this directory, with
the contents of this file being the sentence: "The door is locked." As an
extra rule, this file must be UNIX format, meaning it can't have a \r.

As we will see in homework 2, creating this "e" file will allow us to make
a game that can't go back through this door (ie, homework 2 will need to
prevent us from doing a "cd .." here, based on the fact that the "e" file
exists).

(Now, as compared to trying to do a "cd .." to go back through a door that
has locked behind us, there is also the idea of trying to go forward into
a subdirectory that has a locked door leading to it. In previous semesters,
we modeled this kind of locked door by denying you permissions to enter the
room, which is a very good analogy for a locked door. This year, however,
because of the part of the game that we are implementing, the only locked
doors are the kind that lock behind us.)

We are now in room G and we cannot go back. But we can go south or west:
-- >s
-- Maintenance room
-- You are in some sort of maintenance room for the museum.  There is a
-- switch on the wall labeled ‘BL’.  There are doors to the west and north.
-- There is a packet of nitric acid here.
-- >w
-- Geological display
-- You are in the geological display.  All of the objects that used to
-- be on display are missing.  There are rooms to the east, west, and
-- north.
-- >n
-- Marine life area
-- You are in the marine life area.  The room is filled with fish tanks,
-- which are filled with dead fish that have apparently died due to
-- starvation.  Doors lead out to the south and east.
-- There is a glass jar here.
-- There is a valuable ruby here.
-- >

We have now seen rooms G-J. But there is something new about these rooms,
because they form a loop, as we see here:
-- >e
-- Classroom
-- There is a packet of glycerine here.
-- >s
-- Maintenance room
-- There is a packet of nitric acid here.
-- >w
-- Geological display
-- >n
-- Marine life area
-- There is a glass jar here.
-- There is a valuable ruby here.
-- >s
-- Geological display
-- >

The above loop introduces a complication to our directory system, because, so
far, each room was located inside of the directory of another room. But that
is a tree structure, so it cannot make a cycle. There is a solution, however:
we will use a link to create the cycle (as described below).

Continuing on:
-- >w
-- Museum lobby
-- You are in the main lobby for the Museum of Natural History.  In the center
-- of the room is the huge skeleton of a dinosaur.  Doors lead out to the
-- south and east.
-- There is a dinosaur bone here.
-- >x bone
-- I see nothing special about that.
-- >x dinosaur
-- Unfortunately you do not know enough about dinosaurs to tell very much about
-- it.  It is very big, though.
-- >x skeleton
-- Unfortunately you do not know enough about dinosaurs to tell very much about
-- it.  It is very big, though.
-- >s
-- Museum entrance
-- You are in front of the Museum of Natural History.  A door leads into
-- the building to the north, and a road leads to the southeast.
-- >se
-- Main-Maple intersection
-- You are at the intersection of Main Street and Maple Ave.  Main street
-- runs north and south, and Maple Ave runs east off into the distance.
-- If you look north and east you can see many intersections, but all of
-- the buildings that used to stand here are gone.  Nothing remains except
-- street signs.
-- There is a road to the northwest leading to a gate that guards a building.
-- >

In our game, we will not go to the streets to the east and west. So there are
only two directions we need to implement: northwest and south. Let's try it:
-- >nw
-- The gate will not open.
-- >x gate
-- It is a large metal gate that is too big to climb over.
-- >

So we see that the gate is closed, and we can't go back northwest. This means
we need a file named nw, containing the sentence: "The gate will not open."
If south is the only ay that we can go, then let's go south:
-- >s
-- Post office
-- You are near the remains of a post office.  There is a mail drop on the
-- face of the building, but you cannot see where it leads.  A path leads
-- back to the east, and a road leads to the north.
-- >x mail
-- It says ‘express mail’ on it.
-- >x drop
-- It says ‘express mail’ on it.
-- >e
-- Meadow
-- You are in a meadow in the back of an old building.  A small path leads
-- to the west, and a door leads to the south.
-- There is a bus driver's license here.
-- There is a silver bar here.
-- >x bar
-- I don't know what that is.
-- >x silver
-- I see nothing special about that.
-- >

So we've seen a few more spots, and the objects in those places. We see
that the silver bar is only identified as "silver", not as "bar". Anyway,
continuing on:
-- >s
-- Old Building hallway
-- You are in the hallway of an old building.  There are rooms to the east
-- and west, and doors leading out to the north and south.
-- >n
-- You don't have a key that can open this door.
-- >

So we have found another door that locks behind us. Therefore we need a
file name "n" which contains the sentence: "You don't have a key that can
open this door." Now looking around the house:
-- >e
-- Mailroom
-- You are in a mailroom.  There are many bins where the mail is usually
-- kept.  The exit is to the west.
-- >x bin
-- All of the bins are empty.  Looking closely you can see that there
-- are names written at the bottom of each bin, but most of them are
-- faded away so that you cannot read them.  You can only make out three
-- names:
--                    Jeffrey Collier
--                    Robert Toukmond
--                    Thomas Stock
-- 
-- >x bins
-- All of the bins are empty.  Looking closely you can see that there
-- are names written at the bottom of each bin, but most of them are
-- faded away so that you cannot read them.  You can only make out three
-- names:
--                    Jeffrey Collier
--                    Robert Toukmond
--                    Thomas Stock
--
-- >

The bin (or bins) have a longer description than other objects, but that
isn't a real difference. Anyway, let's look around some more:
-- >w
-- Old Building hallway
-- >w
-- Computer room
-- You are in a computer room.  It seems like most of the equipment has
-- been removed.  There is a VAX 11/780 in front of you, however, with
-- one of the cabinets wide open.  A sign on the front of the machine
-- says: This VAX is named ‘pokey’.  To type on the console, use the
-- ‘type’ command.  The exit is to the east.
-- The panel lights are steady and motionless.
-- >x vax
-- I see nothing special about that.
-- >x computer
-- I see nothing special about that.
-- >

So there is another computer room, and it also has the computer/vax/pc/
cabinet object. Let's continue:
-- >e
-- Old Building hallway
-- >s
-- Building front
-- You are at the end of the road.  There is a building in front of you
-- to the northeast, and the road leads back to the southwest.
-- >n
-- You can't go that way.
-- >ne
-- You don't have a key that can open this door.
-- >

Well, we have another door locking behind us. But this time it is strange.
We went south to exit the house, but the door is located to the northeast
(instead of to the north). The solution to this is that we will need two
files: one named "n" that holds "You can't go that way.", and one named
"ne" that holds "You don't have a key that can open this door."

We're getting near the end. Let's keep going:
-- >sw
-- NE/SW road
-- You are on a northeast/southwest road.
-- >sw
-- Fork
-- You are at a fork of two passages, one to the northeast, and one to the
-- southeast.  The ground here seems very soft. You can also go back west.
-- >w
-- E/W Dirt road
-- You are on the continuation of a dirt road.  There are more trees on
-- both sides of you.  The road continues to the east and west.
-- There is a large boulder here.
-- >x boulder
-- It is just a boulder.  It cannot be moved.
-- >x tree
-- They are palm trees with a bountiful supply of coconuts in them.
-- >x trees
-- They are palm trees with a bountiful supply of coconuts in them.
-- >x coconut
-- I see nothing special about that.
-- >

We see that there are many objects here with boulder. Let's continue on:
-- >w
-- Dead end
-- You are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.
-- In the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The
-- trees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant
-- from each other.
-- There is a shovel here.
-- >x coconut
-- I see nothing special about that.
-- >x tree
-- They are palm trees with a bountiful supply of coconuts in them.
-- >

The same trees are in this place. There is also a shovel. But its a
dead end, so let's go back:
-- >e
-- E/W Dirt road
-- There is a large boulder here.
-- >e
-- Fork
-- >look
-- Fork
-- You are at a fork of two passages, one to the northeast, and one to the
-- southeast.  The ground here seems very soft. You can also go back west.
-- >

Here we notice the hint that the ground is soft. We remember that there was
a shovel back at the dead end. Yes, there is something buried here: a cpu.
Since in it buried, however, we should make it a hidden object ".cpu".
Note: we won't be getting the shovel or digging it up in homework #1.
Note also: the cpu object can also be called a "board", "chip" or "card".
But this doesn't affect homework #1, because just making a hidden cpu is
enough for our purpose.

Continuing on:
-- >se
-- SE/NW road
-- You are on a southeast/northwest road.
-- There is some food here.
-- >se
-- Bear hangout
-- You are standing at the end of a road.  A passage leads back to the
-- northwest.
-- There is a ferocious bear here!
-- >

This bear is hiding a key. So the "key" file needs to be a hidden file
in this directory.

Although it says that we are at the end of the road, there is a secret
place to the southwest of here. since it is hidden the name of its
directory should be ".sw". Let's go see it:
-- >sw
-- Hidden area
-- You are in a well-hidden area off to the side of a road.  Back to the
-- northeast through the brush you can see the bear hangout.
-- There is an emerald bracelet here.
-- >

This is the final directory in the game! It is room Z (because there are
26 rooms). It has a bracelet. There is one more thing to try, however:
-- >ne
-- Bear hangout
-- There is a ferocious bear here!
-- >x bear
-- It looks like a grizzly to me.
-- >nw
-- SE/NW road
-- There is some food here.
-- >se
-- Bear hangout
-- There is a ferocious bear here!
-- >se
-- The bear is very annoyed that you would be so presumptuous as to try
-- and walk right by it.  He tells you so by tearing your head off.
-- 
-- You are dead.
-- You have scored 0 out of a possible 90 points.
-- %

Trying to walk past the bear was a fatal mistake. What it means for
homework 1 is that the five lines of text about the bear killing you
need to go into a file named "se".

 -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -

So that is the walkthrough. There are 26 rooms in the part of the game
that you will be designing the rooms for. I've mapped these 26 rooms
to the 26 letters of the alphabet, as shown here:
   a Museum station
   b N/S tunnel
   c North end of N/S tunnel
   d Bottom of subway stairs
   e Endgame computer room
   f Top of subway stairs
   g Classroom
   h Maintenance room
   i Geological display
   j Marine life area
   k Museum lobby
   l Museum entrance
   m Main-Maple intersection
   n Post office
   o Meadow
   p Old Building hallway
   q Mailroom
   r Computer room
   s Building front
   t NE/SW road
   u Fork
   v E/W Dirt road
   w Dead end
   x SE/NW road
   y Bear hangout
   z Hidden area


They are connected as shown here (this should be viewed with a fixed-width font):
