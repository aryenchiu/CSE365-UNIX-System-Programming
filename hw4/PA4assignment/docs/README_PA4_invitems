You've already seen README file that describes how to implement the hereitems
alias. This current README file describes how to design a new alias that has
some similarities to the hereitems alias.

The new alias is named "invitems", and it deals with how items display when in
the inventory. To review how items display, let's look at all the "i" commands
in the PA4walkthrough2.txt file that I have provided in the same posting as this present README file:

  % cat PA4walkthrough2.txt | tr "\n>" "@\n" | grep -n ^i | tr "@\n" "\n>" | sed 's/>\([0-9]*:\)/\1\n>/'
  35:i

  >%


To summarze the above, here is how each item prints:
"A silver bar", "A glass jar", "A computer board", "A brass key",
"Some nitric acid", "Some glycerine", "Some food", "An amethyst",
"A lamp", "A license", "A bone", "A ruby", "A bracelet", "A shovel".

And when inside the jar, the items are indented 5 spaces, just like with
hereitems.

Now, as we consider how to implement invitems, let's notice the differences
versus hereitems:
  1) They display differently. For example the cpu/chip/card/board displays as
     "There is a CPU card here." but lists in inventory as "A computer board".
     And "There is a shiny brass key here." compares to "A brass key".
  2) They run in different directories. When hereitems is invoked, we imagine
     that the current directory is the room. But when invitems is invoked, we
     imagine that the current directory is ~/D/inv. (Note: neither of these
     aliases requires that you be in any specific directory; those directories
     are just the use-cases that we expect.)
  3) Since the directories these aliases run in are different, the wildcard
     patterns used to list the contents will also be different. For example,
     the invitems alias need not worry about objects like the blackboard.
  4) Since the directories these aliases run in are different, the invitems
     alias cannot use the trick that hereitems had used, where hereitems knew
     that there was always description file in the current directory. Since
     we do not have such an always-present file in the case of invitems, we'll
     need to create our own file, in order to fix the problem with showing a
     jar when nothing else is in the inventory. (A post to the cyberuniversity
     labeled "A note on hereitems" discussed this problem.)

Now before going into the details of invitems, there are two rules:
  1) You cannot use anything except sed "s" commands to complete this alias.
  2) For full points, the character length of this alias must be as short as
     possible. (There was no such rule for hereitems.)

And now for the details. Fill in the blanks (____) below:

alias invitems 'touch X && ls --color=never [^cen]* | sed "__1__;...__X__" |\
grep .|tr \\n @|sed "__X+1;...__Y__";rm X


In the above we first use touch to create a temporary file named X, which we
will need to have so that we can fix the problem with the jar when it is the
only thing in the inventory.

Next, we use ls to display the objects which can be in the inventory, without
showing the aliases. I also used "--color=never" because I was getting ugly
color in my output.

Next, the "s" commands of __1__ to __X__ are used to do everything except for
indentation. So these "s" commands add all of the adjectives (eg, "nitric 
acid" or "silver bar"), and these "s" commands add the "A" or "An" or "Some"
articles, as needed. It also create the "The jar contains:" output.

Next, the "grep ." removes empty lines, and the "tr \\n @" gets everything on
one line so that indentation can be done (just like you needed to do for
hereitems).

Next, the __X+1__ to __Y__ are used to add the indentation.

Finally, the "rm X" gets rid of the temporary file that we had created to
fix the problem with the jar.
