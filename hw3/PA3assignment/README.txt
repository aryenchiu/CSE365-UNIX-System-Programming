                            UNIX System Programming
                           Programming Assignment #3

Due: Saturday, April 9  at  11:59 pm. 
     Submissions made after the deadline will be ignored. (But, as always, you
     can email me the late file immediately, and later we can discuss if you
     have a good reason for lateness.)
     
     The midterm is on April 11, and so a solution to PA3 will be posted on
     Sunday afternoon. (So any email answers after then would be meaningless.)

Submission method: Submit one file named "PA3.sh".
                   You will post to the course website, just like the previous
                   assignment. 

Getting help:   - Professor office hours: Monday 12:00-2:00 either in room
                  5012 or room 9037, and Friday 10:00-12:00 in room 9037.
                  Or by email at stevewhaga@yahoo.com (please use English).
                - The TA is also available to answer your questions.
                - Questions about the assignment can be posted to the 
                  Discussion Forum.
                - You may also discuss the ideas of the assignment with your
                  classmates. Such discussions can be quite helpful to your 
                  learning -- IF you ONLY talk about the general concepts of
                  the steps of the assignment.
                  - If, however, you tell other students the specific details
                    of your implementation, then you aren't helping each other
                    to learn; you are just doing the work for them.
                    In other words, you are cheating. You CANNOT show another
                    student ANY part of the answer to the assignment.

Cheating policy:  We encourage students to form study groups. But this doesn't
                  mean sharing code. If students are found to be sharing work,
                  they can receive a 0 for the entire course, or worse.
                  It is cheating to let another student see your work, or to 
                  let them look over your shoulder when your code is on the
                  screen.
                  A good way to know you cheated: if you have code that is in
                  your solution just because another student told you to put
                  it there, but you don't actually understand it.
                  If you are still unsure, you can ask the TA for more
                  explanation.
                  We always look for evidence of cheating, so don't do it.
                  (In any event, even if you do not get caught, those who 
                  copy the homework will not learn the material, so they 
                  will fail the exam.)

Most Important    The programming assignments are a large part of the grade.
Things to Know:   This large point value means that, if you don't do them, you
                  will likely fail.
                  The large point value also explains why the policy against
                  cheating is so strictly enforced.

The goal of this new assignment is to creating a mostly-working game by
modifying "hereitems" and "i", as well as implementing "get" and "drop".

You have probably read the earlier postings to cyberuniversity. The files
contained in this tar file are unchanged from those. But, in case you haven't
read them, here is a full summary of all of the posts.

Looking at the files in this tarred directory, you will see:
   % ls
   PA1.tar              README_for_get.txt
   PA3walkthrough.txt   README_for_hereitems.txt
   README.txt           README_for_i.txt
   README_for_drop.txt  walkthroughComparisonToRealGame.txt
   %

One of the provided files is a new PA1.txt, which has added subdirectories
named "get" and "There is a" into the dunnet directory. Use this version of
PA1.tar for this assignment.

To start understanding the assignment, you should read PA3walkthrough.txt,
then walkthroughComparisonToRealGame.txt.

Then you should implement the easier aliases first.

Therefore, first do the "i" alias and check that it works.

Then do the "drop" alias.

Then do the "get" alias.

Then do the "hereitems" alias.


Good luck. Please email me questions (in English) at stevewhaga@yahoo.com.

Remember to also study for your midterm.
